# ES6: Hey look, JS is good now!. ES6 gettin good. JavaScript gets serious: ES6 and beyond.

>> If you weren't paying close attention you may have missed JavaScript morphing into a really good language. Shedding warts from its "Lisp in C's Clothing" past, the latest updates bring a stack of functional features that make coding in Plain ol' JavaScript plain good fun. Earle will cover what's here, what's just around the corner, and argue that it may be time to put your transpiler out to pasture.
